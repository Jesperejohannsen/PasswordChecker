# PasswordChecker

We use an API from pwnedpasswords.com to crosscheck our inputted password. 

It generates the password with the help of hashing.

If our password is already in use our code will tell us how many times it has been used.

If our password haven't been used it will also tell us.

In our cmd prompt it will show us the genereted password. It will show us the lines seperated as in k-anonymity
